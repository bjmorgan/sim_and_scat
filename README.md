This is the repository for an open educational resource designed to introduce users of scattering and diffraction to molecular simulation. 
This is inspired by the popularity of molecular dynamics simulations as a tool to aid in the analysis of scattering experiments. 

The resource can be found online at [arm61.github.io/sim_and_scat/00_schedule.html](https://arm61.github.io/sim_and_scat/00_schedule.html).
