    "**Classical molecular dynamics** (MD) is a common computational chemistry technique for studying complex systems, such as proteins, polymers, and battery materials [1-4].\n",
    "Alongside the interest in these and other applications, molecular dynamics is also a used to help analyse data obtained from elastic scattering instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial has been written to **introduce users of elastic-scattering techniques**, such as small angle scattering or diffraction, to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.\n",
    "We hope that this tutorial can provide an accessible route for experimental researchers to **better understand some of the complexities and subtleties  of MD simulation**, thereby helping these researchers to get more relevant information from their simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial begins with an introduction to classical simulation methods, including a discussion of the development and parameterisation of classical interatomic potential models. \n",
    "We then provide an outline of traditional molecular dynamics simulation methods and discuss a number of important considerations users of MD simulation should be aware of. \n",
    "We close this tutorial with an illustrative practical example, using the [open-source Lennard-Jones simulation package `pylj`](https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00019) [5], and discuss how a radially averaged scattering profile may be obtained **directly from simulation** via the Debye equation [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to emphasise that this tutorial is in **no way** a complete course on molecular dynamics, and would direct the interested reader to one of the many detailed textbooks on this subject [7-11]. \n",
    "Rather, it is our hope that this tutorial provides a simple, practical, **general introduction to new, or future, users of MD methods within the scattering community**."
