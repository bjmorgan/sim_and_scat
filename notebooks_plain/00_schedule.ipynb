    "Molecular dynamics are hugely popular to aid in the analysis of data obtained from elastic scattering instruments [[9]](#References). \n",
    "However, many experimentalists hope to use molecular dynamics simulation as a black box. \n",
    "The aim of this tutorial is to introduce users of elastic scattering techniques, such as small angle scattering or diffraction, to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.\n",
    "We hope this that the opportunity to more fully understand the complexity of MD simulation will engage experimentalists to interact more closely with the simulations they hope to utilise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce classical MD simulation, in terms of a two-dimensional argon system, using the open-source package pylj[[1]](#References), and show how it is possible to determine radially averaged scattering profiles directly from the simulation (using the Debye equation [[2]](#References) and other more efficient methods such as the Golden Vectors approximation [[3]](#References))\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many important textbooks what may be referred to which give a more broad introduction to classical simulation, and computational modelling in general [[4-8]](#References). \n",
    "However, the focus of this work is to offer a general introduction to those from the scattering community."
